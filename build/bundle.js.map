Note: es5-sham.js requires\n * es5-shim.js to be able to work properly.\n *\n * `json3.js` monkey-patches the EcmaScript 5 JSON implimentation faithfully.\n *\n * `es6.shim.js` provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines\n * behave as closely as possible to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony).\n *\n * @version 1.0.6\n * @author Xotic750 <Xotic750@gmail.com>\n * @copyright  Xotic750\n * @license {@link <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT> MIT}\n * @module is-function-x\n */\n\n/*jslint maxlen:80, es6:false, white:true */\n\n/*jshint bitwise:true, camelcase:true, curly:true, eqeqeq:true, forin:true,\n  freeze:true, futurehostile:true, latedef:true, newcap:true, nocomma:true,\n  nonbsp:true, singleGroups:true, strict:true, undef:true, unused:true,\n  es3:true, esnext:false, plusplus:true, maxparams:1, maxdepth:1,\n  maxstatements:8, maxcomplexity:4 */\n\n/*global module */\n\n;(function () {\n  'use strict';\n\n  var fToString = Function.prototype.toString;\n  var toStringTag = require('to-string-tag-x');\n  var hasToStringTag = require('has-to-string-tag-x');\n  var isPrimitive = require('is-primitive');\n  var funcTag = '[object Function]';\n  var genTag = '[object GeneratorFunction]';\n\n  /**\n   * Checks if `value` is classified as a `Function` object.\n   *\n   * @private\n   * @param {*} value The value to check.\n   * @return {boolean} Returns `true` if `value` is correctly classified,\n   * else `false`.\n   */\n  function tryFunctionObject(value) {\n    try {\n      fToString.call(value);\n      return true;\n    } catch (ignore) {}\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Checks if `value` is classified as a `Function` object.\n   *\n   * @param {*} value The value to check.\n   * @return {boolean} Returns `true` if `value` is correctly classified,\n   * else `false`.\n   * @example\n   * var isFunction = require('is-function-x');\n   *\n   * isFunction(); // false\n   * isFunction(Number.MIN_VALUE); // false\n   * isFunction('abc'); // false\n   * isFunction(true); // false\n   * isFunction({ name: 'abc' }); // false\n   * isFunction(function () {}); // true\n   * isFunction(new Function ()); // true\n   * isFunction(function* test1() {}); // true\n   * isFunction(function test2(a, b) {}); // true\n   * isFunction(class Test {}); // true\n   * isFunction((x, y) => {return this;}); // true\n   */\n  module.exports = function isFunction(value) {\n    if (isPrimitive(value)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (hasToStringTag) {\n      return tryFunctionObject(value);\n    }\n    var strTag = toStringTag(value);\n    return strTag === funcTag || strTag === genTag;\n  };\n}());\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/is-function-x/index.js\n ** module id = 71\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","/* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */\n'use strict';\nvar hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;\nvar propIsEnumerable = Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;\n\nfunction toObject(val) {\n\tif (val === null || val === undefined) {\n\t\tthrow new TypeError('Object.assign cannot be called with null or undefined');\n\t}\n\n\treturn Object(val);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Object.assign || function (target, source) {\n\tvar from;\n\tvar to = toObject(target);\n\tvar symbols;\n\n\tfor (var s = 1; s < arguments.length; s++) {\n\t\tfrom = Object(arguments[s]);\n\n\t\tfor (var key in from) {\n\t\t\tif (hasOwnProperty.call(from, key)) {\n\t\t\t\tto[key] = from[key];\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) {\n\t\t\tsymbols = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(from);\n\t\t\tfor (var i = 0; i < symbols.length; i++) {\n\t\t\t\tif (propIsEnumerable.call(from, symbols[i])) {\n\t\t\t\t\tto[symbols[i]] = from[symbols[i]];\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn to;\n};\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/object-assign/index.js\n ** module id = 72\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","/**\n * Copyright 2013-2015, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

Note: es5-sham.js requires\n * es5-shim.js to be able to work properly.\n *\n * `json3.js` monkey-patches the EcmaScript 5 JSON implimentation faithfully.\n *\n * `es6.shim.js` provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines\n * behave as closely as possible to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony).\n *\n * @version 1.0.13\n * @author Xotic750 <Xotic750@gmail.com>\n * @copyright  Xotic750\n * @license {@link <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT> MIT}\n * @module is-array-buffer-x\n */\n\n/*jslint maxlen:80, es6:false, white:true */\n\n/*jshint bitwise:true, camelcase:true, curly:true, eqeqeq:true, forin:true,\n  freeze:true, futurehostile:true, latedef:true, newcap:true, nocomma:true,\n  nonbsp:true, singleGroups:true, strict:true, undef:true, unused:true,\n  es3:true, esnext:false, plusplus:true, maxparams:2, maxdepth:3,\n  maxstatements:14, maxcomplexity:6 */\n\n/*global module */\n\n;(function () {\n  'use strict';\n\n  var isObjectLike = require('is-object-like-x');\n  var hasABuf = typeof ArrayBuffer === 'function';\n  var toStringTag, aBufTag, bLength;\n\n  if (hasABuf) {\n    if (require('has-to-string-tag-x')) {\n      try {\n        bLength = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(\n          ArrayBuffer.prototype,\n          'byteLength'\n        ).get;\n        bLength =\n          typeof bLength.call(new ArrayBuffer(4)) === 'number' && bLength;\n      } catch (ignore) {\n        bLength = null;\n      }\n    }\n    if (!bLength) {\n      toStringTag = require('to-string-tag-x');\n      aBufTag = '[object ArrayBuffer]';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Determine if an `object` is an `ArrayBuffer`.\n   *\n   * @param {*} object The object to test.\n   * @return {boolean} `true` if the `object` is an `ArrayBuffer`,\n   *  else false`.\n   * @example\n   * var isArrayBuffer = require('is-array-buffer-x');\n   *\n   * isArrayBuffer(new ArrayBuffer(4)); // true\n   * isArrayBuffer(null); // false\n   * isArrayBuffer([]); // false\n   */\n  module.exports = function isArrayBuffer(object) {\n    if (!hasABuf || !isObjectLike(object)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (!bLength) {\n      return toStringTag(object) === aBufTag;\n    }\n    try {\n      return typeof bLength.call(object) === 'number';\n    } catch (ignore) {}\n    return false;\n  };\n}());\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/is-array-buffer-x/index.js\n ** module id = 184\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar getDay = Date.prototype.getDay;\nvar tryDateObject = function tryDateObject(value) {\n\ttry {\n\t\tgetDay.call(value);\n\t\treturn true;\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n};\n\nvar toStr = Object.prototype.toString;\nvar dateClass = '[object Date]';\nvar hasToStringTag = typeof Symbol === 'function' && typeof Symbol.toStringTag === 'symbol';\n\nmodule.exports = function isDateObject(value) {\n\tif (typeof value !== 'object' || value === null) { return false; }\n\treturn hasToStringTag ?

Defaults to false.\n * - depth - tells inspect how many times to recurse while fmtting the\n * object. This is useful for inspecting large complicated objects.\n * Defaults to 2.

Defaults to true.\n *\n * <h2>Customizing inspect colors</h2>\n * Color out (if enabled) of inspect is customizable globally\n * via `inspect.styles` and `inspect.colors` objects.\n *\n * The `inspect.styles` is a map assigning each style a color\n * from `inspect.colors`. Highlighted styles and their default values are:\n * - number (yellow)\n * - boolean (yellow)\n * - string (green)\n * - date (magenta)\n * - regexp (red)\n * - null (bold)\n * - undefined (grey)\n * - special - only function at this time (cyan)\n * - name (intentionally no styling)\n *\n * Predefined color codes are:\n * - white\n * - grey\n * - black\n * - blue\n * - cyan\n * - green\n * - magenta\n * - red\n * - yellow.\n *\n * There are also:\n *  - bold\n *  - italic\n *  - underline\n *  - inverse\n *\n * <h2>Custom inspect() function on Objects</h2>\n * Objects also may define their own `inspect(depth)` function which `inspect`\n * will invoke and use the result of when inspecting the object.\n *\n * You may also return another Object entirely, and the returned String will\n * be fmtted according to the returned Object. This is similar to\n * how JSON.stringify() works.\n *\n * <h2>ECMAScript compatibility shims for legacy JavaScript engines</h2>\n * `es5-shim.js` monkey-patches a JavaScript context to contain all EcmaScript 5\n * methods that can be faithfully emulated with a legacy JavaScript engine.\n *\n * `es5-sham.js` monkey-patches other ES5 methods as closely as possible.\n * For these methods, as closely as possible to ES5 is not very close.\n * Many of these shams are intended only to allow code to be written to ES5\n * without causing run-time errors in older engines. In many cases,\n * this means that these shams cause many ES5 methods to silently fail.\n * Decide carefully whether this is what you want. Note: es5-sham.js requires\n * es5-shim.js to be able to work properly.\n *\n * `json3.js` monkey-patches the EcmaScript 5 JSON implimentation faithfully.\n *\n * `es6.shim.js` provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines\n * behave as closely as possible to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony).\n *\n * @example\n * var util = require('inspect-x');\n *\n * var obj = { name: 'nate' };\n * obj.inspect = function(depth) {\n *   return '{' + this.name + '}';\n * };\n *\n * inspect(obj);\n *   // \"{nate}\"\n *\n * var obj = { foo: 'this will not show up in the inspect() out' };\n *
